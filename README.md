- Login in to an account
- Add items to the bag
- Search items
- View items by category

# Wireframes

I used Google Slides to show my wireframes so it would keep the README clean and tidy.

# Bugs and Fixes

  | Bugs/Errors        |   Explain   | Fix |
   | -------------  |:-------------:| -----: |
   | Searched items wasn't showing | I was having issues with searched item text wasn't showing | There was an indention error  |
   | Delivery price was wrong | I was having issues with the delivery price being wrong | I fixed this by adding ``{{ item.product.price  calculate_total:item.quantity }}`` |
   | Delivery too high | I was having issues with the the delivery being too high | I fixed this by changing the percentage to ``STANDARD_DELIVERY_PERCENTAGE = 0.1`` |
   | Overlapping | I was having issues with overlapping information on mobile | Turns out I had ``{% include 'includes/mobile-top-header.html' %}`` in twice|
   | Home Button | Home button wasn't an option on medium screens | I solved this with adding ``d-lg-none`` |
   | DB Issue | When I changed to codeanywhere my DB file didn't transfer over from gitpod | With the help of tutor support. I had to pull the info from my DB and put it in a json file using ``python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json`` |
   | Order History | Order Total, Delivery Total and Grand total not updating | Unresolved - Explained below. |

## Unresolved Bugs

* Order History
  - This was unresolved.
  - After talking with tutor support and running out of weekly hours we couldn't find a fix sadly. After checking Slack, checking Google and debugging its unresolved.
  - Unfortunately this bug didn't exist on my local enviorment. Order Histort works as it should locally (Still does) but on the deployed version this is bug.
